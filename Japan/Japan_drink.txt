You go to the edge of the river bed, bending down and cupping the water in your hands. You take a sip of the water and smile at the forest on the other side of the river. Looking back
the old man is laughing at you. You don't understand what he is saying, but he gesters to you that he just pissed in the river. You spit the water out and look suprised. What will you do now?

With your newly found object, you feel the urge to kill. You smash the metal object over the head of the old man. He collapses down, and you continue to smash the jug over his head. His head collapsing inward, and brain tissue meeting the river bed below. He falls into the river. Standing over his body, you look up to notice a Japanese lady from across the river watching you. She runs off. What will 
you do?

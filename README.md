Develop a statement of purpose and scope for your application. It must include:
- describe at a high level what the application will do
- identify the problem it will solve and explain why you are developing it
- identify the target audience
- explain how a member of the target audience will use it

The 

statment of purpose

Have you ever played an old school adventure game for it to break the illusion when it states that it doesnâ€™t understand a command. 

Adventure games 

I had set out to create an experience that would hopefully give you full control over what you truely desire. The concept was that if you could do anything that you wanted to do. Go to West Germany during World War 2 to assiante Hilter. You could do it. Go jam with the Beatles or Jimi Hendrix? Go do it. 

However, this complete freedom would mean that an infitite array of possibilities. Even with a slight degree of game play manlipulation; such as coarsing the player with carefully suggestied ideas.

In the end, I had to submit like some before me

Peter Monize -Fable
No Man's Sky
That little fish n chip shop in Sydney that is meant to be the best

I had to change ideas slightly. Some of the original code still exists as a precursor to a future project

Much like adventure games, this game will still hopefully give you choices. It's more a test on what the player may type.


The problem it will solve is hopefully bordem, and hopefully bring a smile to the face of the user. Looking back I wished I had designed an app that would change the world, but instead, maybe bringing a smile to the face or something, along with a semi-soft challenging puzzle on how to get out of a room.



The problem lies with the sheer scope of it


Not only being able to decide on what you want to say,

The story involves you waking up in a white room. The only thing there is an old toilet. Cables and wires come out from the porcal throne. What you won't know until you sit on it, is that the toilet is a time machine

the problem will solve boredom and hopefully make people laugh. Deep down, this idea is more of a test on human condition. For instance, giving people the option to do what they want will be an interesting concept. Most games will have restrictions on what you can do, whereas here, I will attempt to give feedom to the choices that people will make.

The test for human condition is interesting and may allow people to do stuff that would only be performed in the deep areas of the psyche. Let me give you an example

Let say you go back to Germany during World War 2. If given the choice, would you kill Hilter, or maybe you would try to kiss Hilter. While this option seems like a no brainer, this game may hopefully give you a 'what if' situation

the target audience is for people that love old school adventure games, or that are interested in history or how screwing up the past can have drastic effects on the present

You open your eyes to the screams of tortured souls. The unpleasant smell of sulfur enters your nose. The crackling sound of human flesh slowly creeps upon you. 

Luckily this is just a weird vision as hell doesn't exist. It's used for control by religious organisations as a way to push their reglious beliefs on you.

However, because you wanted to go here, maybe you are a firm believer in the afterlife. So you die from the sheer scare of being in such a horrible place.

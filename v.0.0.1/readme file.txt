statment of purpose

Have you ever played an old school adventure game for it to break the illusion when it states that it doesn’t understand a command. 

Adventure games 

I had set out to create an experience that will hopefully give you full control over what you truely desire.

Not only being able to decide on what you want to say,

The story involves you waking up in a white room. The only thing there is an old toilet. Cables and wires come out from the porcal throne. What you won't know until you sit on it, is that the toilet is a time machine

the problem will solve boredom and hopefully make people laugh. Deep down, this idea is more of a test on human condition. For instance, giving people the option to do what they want will be an interesting concept. Most games will have restrictions on what you can do, whereas here, I will attempt to give feedom to the choices that people will make.

The test for human condition is interesting and may allow people to do stuff that would only be performed in the deep areas of the psyche. Let me give you an example

Let say you go back to Germany during World War 2. If given the choice, would you kill Hilter, or maybe you would try to kiss Hilter. While this option seems like a no brainer, this game may hopefully give you a 'what if' situation

the target audience is for people that love old school adventure games, or that are interested in history or how screwing up the past can have drastic effects on the present

You bend down and try to pick up the object. The water lashes at your face. You feel the object within your hands and you pull it up. It's nothing more than an old metal jug. Pleased with yourself 
you show it to the old man. He scoffs and continues to fish. You make your way back to the river shore with the object in hand. What shall you do now?
